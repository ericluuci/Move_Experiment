# Move_Experiment

This prototype is written in python 2.7 and requires pygame to run.

The game consists of two components, a moveable block and the surrounding platforms that constrict movement. The player can move side to side using arrow keys or 'a'/'d' but cannot jump. This was my first experiment into physics-based motion, as prior to this, many of my programs required multiple presses to build speed, yet this program allows the user to hold down the button to move.

The updated program that includes jumping and more platforms is in 'https://github.com/ericluuci/Physics_Experiment' or in my 'Physics_Experiment' repo
